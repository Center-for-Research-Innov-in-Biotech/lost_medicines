# lost_medicines
This project catalogues over the counter and compounds lost following implementation of the 1962 Kefauver Harris Amendment, 
thereby offering opportunities for drug re-purposing and a different view of the pharmaceutical industry.

The file "Pre-Ke Data for Paper" contains data used to construct the manuscript: "Lost Medicines: 
A Longer View of the Pharmaceutical Industry with the Potential to Reinvigorate Discovery"
